# File Searcher

This is the coursework done for a system programming class at the University of Washington. C/C++ was used for this program. The application has a google-like web interface that makes server requests based on the user input in the search box. The output will be a list of files/websites that is sorted with most occurrences of the word to least occurrences of the word.

## Content files

The hw1 folder contains 2 data structures that are coded in C: doubly linked-list and a chained hash-table. [Specification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/18su/hw/hw1/hw1.html)

The hw2 folder contains files that parses files, find files, indexes files and processes queries. This is built upon the structures made in hw1. [Specification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/18su/hw/hw2/hw2.html)

The hw3 folder contains files that takes an in-memory inverted index produced by hw2 and writes it out to disk in an architecture-neutral format, walks through an on-disk index to service a lookup and will process queries from multiple on-disk indices. [Specification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/18su/hw/hw3/hw3.html)

The hw4 folder contains files that create a multithreaded Web server front-end to the query processor and addresses security flaws. The flaws addressed are cross-site scripting and telnet'ing. [Specification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/18su/hw/hw4/hw4.html)
